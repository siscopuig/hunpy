- I need item.element to screenshot the ad
- Opening a new tab with the advert.src, then screenshot, save and close.


How to retrieve an image:
 -  There are two kind of methods depending of the file info. If source is:
        -   dynamic:
                text/html
        -   static
                - image/jpeg
                - image/gif
                - image/png
                - image/svg+xml
                - image/tiff
                - image/webp
                - image/bmp
                - image/x-icon)

-   For dynamic (text/html) needs a screenshot element
-   For static needs to use wget command (Discarded for now!!!)

- How do I open a new tab in chrome?
    self.driver.execute_script("window.open('');")

- Store each source taken in a list to check if equal source appears in the same page.
